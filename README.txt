##READ ME

This program has three parts: 
1. load a txt file of Marcus Aurelius's Meditations from Project Gutenberg
2. Parse it into a nested dictionary {book_num: {meditation}}
3. Set up a task to daily DM one random meditation from the book to me via a Slack app

##Note: This project is incomplete
* Steps 1 and 2 are complete, the code successfully generates a random meditation from the book
* Step 3 is incomplete while I wait for authorization from my Slack Workspace administrator
